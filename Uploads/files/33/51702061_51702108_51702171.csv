Were JERKS on the phone,0
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible,0

I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing I noticed was the really bad service,0
I 'll be looking for a new earpiece,0
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement,0
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset,0
This is the first phone I 've had that has been so cheaply made,0
"Att is not clear , sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk",0
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip,0
Do n't make the same mistake I did,0
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone,0
Also the area where my unit broke I 'm not too fond of the magnetic strap,0
"Another note about this phone 's appearance is that it really looks rather bland , especially in the all black model",0
Low Quality,0
"Warning , Stay away",0
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money,0
I used to talk on it for 10 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying,0
"If you do n't find it , too bad , as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyI would not recommend this to anyone",0
Very Displeased,0
"I might have gotten a defect , but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone",0
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install,0
Does not fit,0
There 's really nothing bad I can say about this headset,0
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 percent left in the morning,0
I 've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again,0
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses,0
Horrible phone,0
BT50 battery junk,0
Cant get the software to work with my computer,0
Disappointed,0
poor voice clarity,0
No buyers remorse on this one,0
Very disappointed in Accessory One,0
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers,0
The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome,0
Disappointment I hate anything that goes in my ear,0
"Uncomfortable In the Ear , Do n't use with LG VX9900 EnV",0
The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown,0
I 'd like to return it,0
"Verizon 's bills , however , are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple",0
A Disappointment,0
It 's not user friendly,0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect,0
"Then I exchanged for the same phone , even that had the same problem",0
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute,0
Pretty piece of junk,0
Plug was the wrong size,0
Save your money I 've had this item for 11 months now,0
Bad Purchase,0
Defective crap,0
I would have given no star if I was able,0
"The sound quality for the device is unacceptableUnless you are in a really quiet area , you almost hear nothing",0
I would not recommend this item to anyone,0
The holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad,0
"As an earlier review noted , plug in this charger and nothing happens",0
You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not,0
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone,0
My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5,0
REALLY UGLY,0
"horrible , had to switch 3 times",0
No real improvement,0
They refuse to refund or replace,0
"Unfortunately it 's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle,touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening",0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing,0
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedI am not impressed and I am not laughing,0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly,0
I 've missed numerous calls because of this reason,0
"Perhaps my phone is defective , but people cannot hear me when I use this",0
Do n't buy this product,0
"sucked , most of the stuff does not work with my phone",0
Worst software ever used If I could give this zero stars I would,0
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration,0
The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever,0
I give Wirefly 1 starI will contact Cingular and inform them of this practice,0
It 's AGGRAVATING,0
"None of it works , just do n't buy it",0
"Muddy , low quality sound , and the casing around the wire 's insert was poorly super glued and slid off",0
Please dont waste your money,0
"If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking , this is n't it",0
Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design,0
Disapointing Results,0
Cumbersome design,0
It 's A PIECE OF CRAP,0
"My experience was terrible This was my fourth bluetooth headset , and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra which I HATED",0
Worst ever,0
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what,0
The battery life is highly unacceptable,0
That company is a joke,0
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset,0
"Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures , none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re,set , wiping out all my data",0
"Voice Quality , Signal Strength , Dropped Calls",0
"It feels poorly constructed , the menus are difficult to navigate , and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them",0
Also difficult to put onI 'd recommend avoiding this product,0
"I only used it two days , and it was n't always easy to hear with",0
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokenI went to plug it in and it started smoking,0
"Sprint , terrible customer service",0
"What possesed me to get this junk , I have no idea",0
Piece of trash,0
"The real killer is the volume , and of course it breaking",0
Poor Construction,0
This is infuriating,0
Sprint charges for this service,0
"It is cheap , and it feel and look just as cheap",0
It does n't work in Europe or Asia,0
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy Samsung is the worst i have ever seeen,0
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone,0
Poor product,0
However I needed some better instructions,0
You need two hands to operate the screenThis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs,0
"Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens , which come in a three,pack",0
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS,0
"Plus , I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point",0
Very Dissapointing Performance,0
Do n't make the same mistake that I did and please do n't buy this phone,0
This phone might well be the worst I 've ever had in any brand,0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear,0
Do n't bother go to the store,0
You get what you pay for I guess,0
"However , BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first person shooters since the audio delay messes me up",0
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer,0
"Performed awful muffled , tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call",0
"Obviously they have a terrible customer service , so you get what you pay for",0
"I contacted the company and they told me that , although the unit was still under warranty , if I could n't produce my receipt I was out of luck",0
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something,0
"When I placed my treo into the case , not only was it NOT snug , but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides",0
Battery is terrible,0
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear,0
Utter crap Sound quality is TERRIBLE,0
"The charger arrived within the promised timeframe , but it did not work",0
"Finally , after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor",0
Talk about USELESS customer service,0
It felt too light and tinny,0
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in,0
I could not recommend these more,0
"Looks good in the picture , but this case was a huge disappointment",0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it,0
A must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design,0
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off,0
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping,0
Can not upload ringtones from a third party,0
"Bluetooth does not work , phone locks up , screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked",0
Truly awful,0
And none of the tones is acceptable,0
camera color balance is AWFUL,0
"This product is clearly not ready for prime time , I do n't care how cool it looks , if you can not tell a call is coming in it 's worthless",0
Chinese Forgeries Abound,0
The instructions did n't explain that a microphone jack could be used,0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well,0
Too bad you have to pay up to money a month for the service,0
The nokia USB cable did not work with my phone,0
"The biggest complaint I have is , the battery drains superfast",0
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear,0
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster,0
It does n't make you look cool,0
"Also , the phone does n't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s , preferably ripped by Windows Media Player",0
So just beware,0
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation,0
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since,0
Can not store anything but phone numbers to SIM,0
"It lasts less than 3o minutes , if I actually try to use the phoneMy wife has the same phone with the same problem",0
Poor quality,0
Not worth it,0
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced,0
"Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s , despite connecting it from multiple power sources iMac , external battery , wall outlet , etc",0
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells and whistles are mediocre,0
Think it over when you plan to own this oneThis sure is the last MOTO phone for me,0
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke,0
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears,0
We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months Pros,0
"Could n't use the unit with sunglasses , not good in Texas",0
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320,0
"Bought mainly for the charger , which broke soon after purchasing",0
"If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations , then this phone is for you",0
"stay away from this store , be careful",0
Does not fit,0
disappointing,0
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors I 'd rather be using a disposable then this,0
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use,0
The nano stated itMy son was dissapointed,0
Would not reccommend,0
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone,0
wont work right or atleast for me,0
"in addition it feels lamp , looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic",0
But now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccure Bottom line put your money somewhere else Cingular will not support it,0
"I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one , but it has too many issues for meThe good",0
AFter the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes,0
"VERY cheap plastic , creaks like an old wooden floor",0
"I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment , where with other phones I have not had this problem",0
"After my phone got to be about a year old , it 's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part",0
I am sorry I made this purchase,0
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear,0
Treo and T Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount,0
It was horrible,0
I do n't think it would hold it too securly on your belt,0
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first,0
They work about 2 weeks then break,0
I can not use this case because the smell is disgusting,0
NOT WHAT I WANTED,0
"The internet access was fine , it the rare instance that it worked",0
50 dollar Down the drain,0
I tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and I was still told it was n't great,0
"If there is a wind , it is completely useless",0
Does Not Work,0
"At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at 744 dollar , until I plugged it into my phone V3c Razr",0
Improper description I had to return it,0

"Horrible , horrible protector",0
I do n't like this Nokia either,0
"Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable , and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be3",0
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare,0
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon,0
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE,0
Terrible My car will not accept this cassette,0
"Product is useless , since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with",0
It 's not what it says it is,0

Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily,0
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look,0
How stupid is that,0
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed,0
Could n't figure it out,0
"My phone sounded OK  not great . OK , but my wife 's phone was almost totally unintelligible , she could n't understand a word being said on it",0
So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it,0

Honeslty it did n't taste THAT fresh,0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer,0
Would not go back,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being way overpriced,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only,0
Waitress was a little slow in service,0
"This place is not worth your time , let alone Vegas",0
did not like at all,0
The Burrittos Blah,0
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm , Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed",0
The worst was the salmon sashimi,0
This was like the final blow,0
"seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food , but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere",0
"Poor service , the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table",0
Service sucks,0
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again,0
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and did n't want to eat it for fear of getting sick,0
"Frozen pucks of disgust , with some of the worst people behind the register",0
It 's too bad the food is so damn generic,0
"They have horrible attitudes towards customers , and talk down to each one when customers do n't enjoy their food",0
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant,0
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom,0
"The ripped banana was not only ripped , but petrified and tasteless",0
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes,0
We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy,0
The service was meh,0
"It took over 30 min to get their milkshake , which was nothing more than chocolate milk",0
"I guess I should have known that this place would suck , because it is inside of the Excalibur , but I did n't use my common sense",0
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well,0
"2 times , Very Bad Customer Service ",0
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company,0
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can not wait for the other person to ask to break up,0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating,0
The turkey and roast beef were bland,0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old,0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying,0
"In summary , this was a largely disappointing dining experience",0
"Never been to Hard Rock Casino before , WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN",0
say bye bye to your tip lady,0
We 'll never go again,0
It was not good,0
"REAL sushi lovers , let 's be honest . Yama is not that good",0
"At least 40 minutes passed in between us ordering and the food arriving , and it was n't that busy",0
It was pretty gross,0
I 've had better atmosphere,0
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did,0
"Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place , the actual experience was a bit disappointing",0
I just do n't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine,0
"Worst service to boot , but that is the least of their worries",0
"Host staff were , for lack of a better word , BITCHES",0
Bland Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I do n't want to waste time on bad reviewing I 'll leave it at that,0
I would n't return,0
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food,0
The management is rude,0
"He was extremely rude and really , there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas",0
Do n't do it,0
The waiter was n't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us,0
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service,0
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and was n't very tasty to me,0
"The menu is always changing , food quality is going down and service is extremely slow",0
"The service was a little slow  , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace",0
I give it 2 thumbs down,0
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us,0
We waited for forty five minutes in vain,0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale,0
"Unfortunately , we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE",0
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed,0
Avoid at all cost,0
So do n't go there if you are looking for good food,0
I 've never been treated so bad,0
"We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad , the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste",0
"Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews , but I 'm not inspired to go back",0
The service here leaves a lot to be desired,0
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order,0
"The burger had absolutely no flavor , the meat itself was totally bland , the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor",0
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack,0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely,0
It was probably dirt,0
"The food sucked , which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined",0
"When my order arrived , one of the gyros was missing",0
I 'm not really sure how Joey 's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine,0
The live music on Fridays totally blows,0
I 've never been more insulted or felt disrespected,0
The warm beer did n't help,0
I 've lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time I 've stepped foot into this place,0
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER,0
Must have been an off night at this place,0
"If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure , but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen",0
"For about 10 minutes , we we 're waiting for her salad when we realized that it was n't coming any time soon",0
will not go back,0
Soggy and not good,0
Which are small and not worth the price,0
"The shower area is outside so you can only rinse , not take a full shower , unless you do n't mind being nude for everyone to see",0
The service was a bit lacking,0
"Lobster Bisque , Bussell Sprouts , Risotto , Filet ALL needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables",0
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in,0
"It was either too cold , not enough flavor or just bad",0
"As for the mains , also uninspired",0
"If the food is n't bad enough for you , then enjoy dealing with the world 's worst or annoying drunk people",0
"Ordered a double cheeseburger and got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded Yeah , still sucks",0
"If it were possible to give them zero stars , they 'd have it",0
"The descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce , yet another said spicy mayo well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them",0
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed Not sure if we will go back and try it again,0
"Horrible , do n't waste your time and money",0
By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse,0
"It was n't busy either Also , the building was FREEZING cold",0
like the other reviewer said you could n't pay me to eat at this place again ,0
Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point,0
"Based on the sub,par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I will not be going back",0
There is nothing privileged about working or eating there,0
"Overall , I do n't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too",0
I as well would 've given godfathers zero stars if possible,0
very tough and very short on flavor,0
"I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas , and do not ever recall being charged for tap water",0
"The service was not up to par , either",0
"For a self proclaimed coffee cafe , I was wildly disappointed",0
"I 've had better , not only from dedicated boba tea spots , but even from Jenni Pho",0
I think not again,0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again,0
Service stinks here,0
I waited and waited,0
"This place is not quality sushi , it is not a quality restaurant",0
"Things that went wrong , They burned the saganaki",0
We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home,0
"I hate to disagree with my fellow Yelpers , but my husband and I were so disappointed with this place",0
Waited 2 hours and never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did,0
Just do n't know why they were so slow,0
"I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I will not be back here , because it is a convenient location",0
Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review,0
Never again will I be dining at this place,0
Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles,0
The potato chip order was sad I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12,0
Food was really boring,0
This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me,0
"Will never , ever go back",0
"As much as I 'd like to go back , I can not get passed the atrocious service and will never return",0
She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted,0
Never going back,0
The bus boy on the other hand was so rude,0
"By this point , my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and did n't mind making it publicly and loudly known",0
The only downside is the service,0
"Also , the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I 've ever had",0
"I go to far too many places and I 've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast , especially for 400 dollars",0
When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad,0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they do n't always honor Pizza Hut coupons,0
Everything was gross,0
"First , the bathrooms at this location were dirty, Seat covers were not replenished and just plain yucky",0
The burger I got the Gold Standard a 17 dollars burger and was kind of disappointed,0
There is nothing authentic about this place,0
the spaghetti is nothing special what so ever,0
The selection was probably the worst I 've seen in Vegasthere was none,0
We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left,0
He was terrible,0
It should n't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs,0
"Sadly , Gordon Ramsey 's Steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to Vegas",0
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND,0
Definitely a turn off for me and i doubt I 'll be back unless someone else is buying,0
"I find wasting food to be despicable , but this just was n't food",0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm,0
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day,0
They dropped more than the ball,0
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best,0
I took back my money and got outta there,0
RUDE and INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT,0
"The staff are now not as friendly , the wait times for being served are horrible , no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes",0
I will not be back,0
The food was terrible,0
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED,0
I do n't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving,0
This place deserves one star and 90 percents has to do with the food,0
This is a disgrace,0
I 'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it,0
This one is simply a disappointment,0
"Overall , I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon",0
I do n't have to be an accountant to know I 'm getting screwed,0
Left very frustrated,0
TOTAL WASTE OF TIME,0
"For service , I give them no stars",0
I can take a little bad service but the food sucks,0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore,0
But now I was completely grossed out,0
"On the ground , right next to our table was a large , smeared , been,stepped,in,and,tracked,everywhere pile of green bird poop",0
"Furthermore , you can not even find hours of operation on the website",0
We 've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we 're done with them,0
What a mistake that was,0
Waiter was a jerk,0
"Strike 2 , who wants to be rushed",0
I never come again,0
Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes,0
It was a huge awkward 15 piece of cow that was 3 or 4ths gristle and fat,0
I 'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere,0
Nothing special,0
Will not be back,0
Sauce was tasteless,0
I do n't think we 'll be going back anytime soon,0
I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food,0
I was so insulted,0
The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad,0
The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten,0
Definitely not worth the 3 dollars I paid,0
The manager was the worst,0
I do n't think I 'll be running back to Carly 's anytime soon for food,0
"This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged , then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things",0
The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading,0
Do n't waste your time here,0
"Total letdown , I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee",0
"Third , the cheese on my friend 's burger was cold",0
We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they did n't bring that either,0
Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh,0
The selection of food was not the best,0
I dont think I will be back for a very long time,0
"It was attached to a gas station , and that is rarely a good sign",0
"Worse of all , he humiliated his worker right in front of meBunch of horrible name callings",0
And then tragedy struck,0
"I 'd rather eat airline food , seriously",0
I would not recommend this place,0
Overall I was n't very impressed with Noca,0
My gyro was basically lettuce only,0
Terrible service,0
Thoroughly disappointed,0
it was a drive to get there,0
"Anyway , I do not think i will go back there",0
"A greasy , unhealthy meal",0
first time there and might just be the last,0
"Similarly , the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late",0
And it was way to expensive,0
Terrible management,0
If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars,0
Worst martini ever,0
We waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting,0
I will not try going back there even if it 's empty,0
"No , I 'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it",0
"not even a hello , we will be right with you ",0
The desserts were a bit strange,0
I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful,0
"However , my recent experience at this particular location was not so good",0
"I know this is not like the other restaurants at all , something is very off here",0
AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT,0
I think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough,0
My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm,0
After two I felt disgusting,0
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone,0
"The servers went back and forth several times , not even so much as an Are you being helped? ",0
AN HOUR seriously?,0
I consider this theft,0
Eew This location needs a complete overhaul,0
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well,0
Waited and waited and waited,0
"The pizza tasted old , super chewy in not a good way",0
I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed,0
Boy was that sucker dry,0
Over rated,0
"If you look for authentic Thai food , go else where",0
After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged,0
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives,0
The kids play area is NASTY,0
It was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless,0
It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor,0
I got home to see the driest damn wings ever,0
Not good for the money,0
"We got sitting fairly fast , but , ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order , another 30 minutes before the food arrived",0
I just wanted to leave,0
I will not be eating there again,0
THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being so cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one,0
I checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed,0
"The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok , the wedges were cold and soggy",0
"Sorry , I will not be getting food from here anytime soon ",0
My friend did not like his Bloody Mary,0
"Despite how hard I rate businesses , its actually rare for me to give a 1 star",0
I will not return,0
I had the chicken Pho and it tasted very bland,0
Very disappointing,0
"a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food , but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait",0
"Best of luck to the rude and non,customer service focused new management",0
Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one,0
I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself,0
"Same evening , him and I are both drastically sick",0
Ordered burger rare came in we 'll done,0
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse,0
"After waiting an hour and being seated , I was not in the greatest of moods",0
I 'm not eating here,0
Maybe if they were n't cold they would have been somewhat edible,0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver,0
Very bad Experience,0
What a mistake,0
Food was average at best,0
We will not be going back anytime soon,0
Very Very Disappointed ordered the 35 dollars Big Bay Plater,0
"Not much flavor to them , and very poorly constructed",0
The fried rice was dry as well,0
Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up,0
dont go here,0
As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means,0
The plantains were the worst I 've ever tasted,0
Service was slow and not attentive,0
Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me,0
Total brunch fail,0
"I probably will not be back , to be honest",0
"Went for lunch , service was slow",0
"We had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing , but was quickly disappointed",0
I was mortified,0
"Needless to say , we will never be back here again",0
"Anyways , The food was definitely not filling at all , and for the price you pay you should expect more",0
"The chips that came out were dripping with grease , and mostly not edible",0
I was n't really impressed with Strip Steak,0
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer,0
Would not recommend to others,0
"I mean really , how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when it 's so terrible",0
Not my thing,0
If you are reading this please do n't go there,0
Tonight I had the Elk Filet specialand it sucked,0
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything,0
A FLY was in my apple juice A FLY,0
"The food was barely lukewarm , so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us",0
Ryan 's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I will not be revisiting,0
"Probably never coming back , and would n't recommend it",0
"Friend 's pasta , also bad , he barely touched it",0
It was way over fried,0
I 'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place,0
"When I opened the sandwich , I was impressed , but not in a good way",0
Will not be back,0
"I have watched their prices inflate , portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly",0
"Main thing I did n't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd , around mid 30s and up",0
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas,0
The service was poor and thats being nice,0
The place was not clean and the food oh so stale,0
"The chicken dishes are OK , the beef is like shoe leather",0
But the service was beyond bad,0
Tasted like dirt,0
My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless,0
"the food is not tasty at all , not to say its real traditional Hunan style ",0
"What did bother me , was the slow service",0
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste,0
So in a nutshell 1 The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer,0
My girlfriend 's veal was very bad,0
"Unfortunately , it was not good",0
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat,0
"The chains , which I 'm no fan of , beat this place easily",0
We will not be coming back,0
Once your food arrives it 's meh,0
Paying 785 dollars for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid 's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal,0
"My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day , and guess what he was sick all night too",0
Mediocre food,0
I 'm super pissd,0
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?,0
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill , but unfortunately the taste fell flat , way flat",0
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food,0
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome I would not suggest this place,0
The service was terrible though,0
"This place is overpriced , not consistent with their boba , and it really is OVERPRICED",0
It was packed,0
The food was terrible,0
It kept getting worse and worse so now I 'm officially done,0
This place should honestly be blown up,0
But I definitely would not eat here again,0
Do not waste your money here,0
Awful service,0
will not ever go here again,0
Food quality has been horrible,0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone,0
The service here is fair at best,0
"I do love sushi , but I found Kabuki to be over,priced , over,hip and under,services",0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish,0
Very poor service,0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it,0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job,0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor,0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small,0
"for 40 bucks a head , i really expect better food",0
I will not be back,0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were,0
This place deserves no stars,0
I would not recommend this place,0
"To my disbelief , each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted",0
"Bad day or not , I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people , it is your job to be nice and polite , wash dishes otherwise",0
I probably would not go here again,0
"The Wife hated her meal coconut shrimp , and our friends really did not enjoy their meals , either",0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they did n't look too appealing,0
I probably will not be coming back here,0
Worst food or service I 've had in a while,0
"Hot dishes are not hot , cold dishes are close to room tempI watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS , no glovesEverything is deep fried in oil",0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best,0
"I started this review with two stars , but I 'm editing it to give it only one",0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco 's,0
Weird vibe from owners,0
There was hardly any meat,0
I 've had better bagels from the grocery store,0
"Now the burgers are n't as good , the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless",0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa,0
"The service was terrible , food was mediocre",0
"I ordered Albondigas soup , which was just warm , and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs",0
"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well , and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate",0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore,0
The service was extremely slow,0
"After 20 minutes wait , I got a table",0
"No allergy warnings on the menu , and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts",0
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom,0
Worst Thai ever,0
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron,0
Spend your money elsewhere,0
The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated,0
"And the drinks are WEAK , people",0
"Also , I feel like the chips are bought , not made in house",0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert,0
We will not be returning,0
I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off,0
"Very , very sad",0
"i felt insulted and disrespected , how could you talk and judge another human being like that?",0
"How can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can not properly cook a steak , I do n't understand",0
I 'm not impressed with the concept or the food,0
The only thing I was n't too crazy about was their guacamole as I do n't like it pured,0
"There is really nothing for me at postinos , hope your experience is better",0
I got food poisoning here at the buffet,0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no,0
"What SHOULD have been a hilarious , yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us",0
"Needless to say , I will not be going back anytime soon",0
This place is disgusting,0
The RI style calamari was a joke,0
"However , there was so much garlic in the fondue , it was barely edible",0
"I could barely stomach the meal , but did n't complain because it was a business lunch",0
"It was so bad , I had lost the heart to finish it",0
It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it,0
We are n't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just do n't get itdefinitely lost the love after this one,0
Disappointing experience,0
"The food is about on par with Denny 's , which is to say , not good at all",0
"If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service , then this is the place for you",0
Wayy over rated is all I am saying,0
We will not be going back,0
The place was fairly clean but the food simply was n't worth it,0
This place lacked style,0
"The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 dollars , ridiculous",0
Do n't bother coming here,0
"The meat was pretty dry , I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork",0
"The building itself seems pretty neat , the bathroom is pretty trippy , but I would n't eat here again",0
It was equally awful,0
Probably not in a hurry to go back,0
very slow at seating even with reservation,0
Not good by any stretch of the imagination,0
The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked,0
"The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless , seemed thin and watered down with no heat",0
"It was a bit too sweet , not really spicy enough , and lacked flavor",0
I was VERY disappointed,0
This place is horrible and way overpriced,0
"Maybe it 's just their Vegetarian fare , but I 've been twice and I thought it was average at best",0
It was n't busy at all and now we know why,0
The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu,0
"The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting , but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits",0
Con spotty service,0
"The fries were not hot , and neither was my burger",0
But then they came back cold,0
"Then our food came out , disappointment ensued",0
The real disappointment was our waiter,0
My husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything,0
The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach,0
"Insults , profound deuchebaggery , and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it",0
If someone orders two tacos do n't you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart,0
She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door,0
After all the rave reviews I could n't wait to eat herewhat a disappointment,0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible,0
It 's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger,0
But I do n't like it,0
Hell no will I go back,0
We 've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant,0
"I do n't know what the big deal is about this place , but I will not be back ya'all ",0
I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar,0
The ambiance is n't much better,0
"Unfortunately , it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees",0
The food was n't good,0
"Your servers suck , wait , correction , our server Heimer sucked",0
What happened next was prettyoff putting,0
"too bad cause I know it 's family owned , I really wanted to like this place",0
Overpriced for what you are getting,0
I vomited in the bathroom mid lunch,0
"I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes , yet still no food",0
"I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to , and this tops the list",0
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously was n't fresh,0
Food was below average,0
It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant,0
"All in all , Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop",0
The problem I have is that they charge 1199 dollars for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables,0
"Shrimp, When I unwrapped it I live only 1 or 2 a mile from Brushfire it was literally ice cold",0
"It lacked flavor , seemed undercooked , and dry",0
It really is impressive that the place has n't closed down,0
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage,0
The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland,0
Spend your money and time some place else,0
A lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar In her salad,0
the presentation of the food was awful,0
I can not tell you how disappointed I was,0
I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking,0
Appetite instantly gone,0
Overall I was not impressed and would not go back,0
"The whole experience was underwhelming , and I think we 'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time",0
"Then , as if I had n't wasted enough of my life there , they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check",0
"A very , very , very slow,moving , aimless movie about a distressed , drifting young man  ",0
"Not sure who was more lost , the flat characters or the audience , nearly half of whom walked out  ",0
"Attempting artiness with black and white and clever camera angles , the movie disappointed , became even more ridiculous , as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non,existent  ",0
Very little music or anything to speak of  ,0
"The rest of the movie lacks art , charm , meaning If it 's about emptiness , it works I guess because it 's empty  ",0
Wasted two hours  ,0
A bit predictable  ,0
"It had some average acting from the main person , and it was a low budget as you clearly can see  ",0
The problem was the script  ,0
It was horrendous  ,0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all  ,0
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were  ,0
"Frankly , after Cotton club and Unfaithful , it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film , because it is BAD  ",0
"The acting was bad , the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere  ",0
"It was too predictable , even for a chick flick  ",0
Too politically correct  ,0
Very disappointing  ,0
"I love Lane , but I 've never seen her in a movie this lousy  ",0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back  ,0
The directing and the cinematography are n't quite as good  ,0
"The movie was so boring , that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a Columbo movie before  ",0
The directing seems too pretentious  ,0
"The scenes with the oh,so,mature neighbour,girl are a misplace  ",0
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode  ,0
"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror , really stupid  ",0
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside  ,0
"However , this did n't make up for the fact that overall , this was a tremendously boring movie  ",0
"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film , and I could n't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife, to be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by  ",0
There were several moments in the movie that just did n't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving  ,0
This was a poor remake of My Best Friends Wedding  ,0
"All in all , a great disappointment  ",0
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film  ,0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing IQ  ,0
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on  ,0
"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful , it 's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these  ",0
I saw Mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience  ,0
"Unfortunately , inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict  ",0
"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly , stereotypically and with no depth of imagination  ",0
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core  ,0
"It is an hour and half waste of time , following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life  ",0
"You can not relate with them , hell you barely can understand them  ",0
"This movie is a pure disaster , the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen , it confuses you incredibly  ",0
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film  ,0
"A truly , truly bad film  ",0
"The acting is terrible , and the writing is worse  ",0
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder  ,0
I paid too much  ,0
It was so BORING  ,0
No plot whatsoever  ,0
"Again , no plot at all  ",0
Horrible  ,0
Worst hour and a half of my lifeOh my gosh  ,0
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief  ,0
I hate movies like that  ,0
"Yeah , the movie pretty much sucked  ",0
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE  ,0
"If you do go see this movie , bring a pillow or a girlfriend or boyfriend to keep you occupied through out  ",0
Awful  ,0
I do n't think I 've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much  ,0
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I 'd have paid 750 dollars to see this crap  ,0
"NOBODY identifies with these characters because they 're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reverse,stereotypes  ",0
"This is a bad film , with bad writing , and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can not handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons  ",0
"Crash is a depressing little nothing , that provokes emotion , but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things  ",0
"Your brain will attempt to shut,down as part of a primal impulse of self,preservation  ",0
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover  ,0
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films  ,0
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way  ,0
I mean this in a terrible way  ,0
This film has no redeeming features  ,0
Everything is appalling  ,0
"Artless camera,work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable , ie  ",0
The story is beyond stupid  ,0
Was there a script?  ,0
The kids are annoying  ,0
The lead man is charisma free  ,0
"Utterly without merit on any level , this is akin to torture  ",0
"I 'll even say it again , this is torture  ",0
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity  ,0
Not a pleasant voyage of self discovery  ,0
Highly unrecommended  ,0
"If this premise sound stupid , that 's because it is  ",0
"Yes , it 's that bad  ",0
Nothing at all to recommend  ,0
"This movie suffered because of the writing , it needed more suspense  ",0
There were too many close ups  ,0
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes did n't really work for their freedom  ,0
But this movie is definitely a below average rent  ,0
"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful , I can only say , it 's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it 's in our human nature to try and make sense of things   ",0
"One more thing I can tolerate political incorrectness very well , I 'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief , but the Slavic female character was just too much  ",0
It 's just lame  ,0
The guy who said he 's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right  ,0
Everything about this movie is stupid  ,0
"Even if you love bad movies , do not watch this movie  ",0
It is shameful  ,0
"The new characters were n't all that memorable , and I found myself forgetting who was who  ",0
I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever  ,0
"It did n't make me scared , horrified , or make me sympathetic towards the characters , it was simply annoying  ",0
The jerky camera movements were also annoying  ,0
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror  ,0
"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth , but it did n't really work into the rest of the plot  ",0
"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist , then shed some light on the situation , but it was just stupid  ",0
"If you see it , you should probably just leave it on the shelf  ",0
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times  ,0
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing  ,0
All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes  ,0
"God , and I can never get that 90 minutes back  ",0
"Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old , fashioned and not very tuneful  ",0
The most annoying thing about Cover Girl is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal  ,0
"Unfortunately , Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain  ",0
I could n't take them seriously  ,0
I am a fan of his  This movie sucked really bad  ,0
Even worse than Ticker  ,0
and That movie was bad  ,0
"Only like 3 or 4 buildings used , a couple of locations MAYBE , and poor hummh  ",0
It just blew  ,0
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda  ,0
"This show is made for Americans , it is too stupid and full with hatred and to be admitted elsewhere  ",0
"Almost everyone involved must be return to school , acting is utterly predictable and bad , script is pile of garbage all round  ",0
"I wish I could enter negative values , admins",0
"The sets are so bad , they would n't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode  ",0
"The use of slow,motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here , no continuity , scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever , vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity  ",0
"Oh yeah , and the storyline was pathetic too  ",0
"I hate writing bad reviews about films , especially those in which I really like the star , but this film is so bad I do n't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it  ",0
I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I 'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie  ,0
"In short , this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film  ",0
It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell  ,0
"1 or 10 , and only because there is no setting for 0 or 10  ",0
"But the acting , even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon , was terrible , the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former , the dialog chimp,like , and the camera work , barely tolerable  ",0
"Yes , I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity , for this really is at the core of the problems with this film , it has too much going on without any real , fulfilling explanation  ",0
"But the convoluted plot just did n't convince me , and much of the film was watched with a weird , questioning glance  ",0
"I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this , bad idea , we both hated it  ",0
"Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous , intoning odd lines  ",0
"The acting was decidely wooden , though no worse than a period Universal B movie  ",0
"Wow , what a bad film  ",0
"Not frightening in the least , and barely comprehensible  ",0
"The plot does n't hang together at all , and the acting is absolutely appalling  ",0
Not even good for camp value  ,0
"I was n't expecting Oscar material , but this",0
You 'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming  ,0
"This film and I use that word loosely is an insult to the movie,going public  ",0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative  ,0
"This gets a 1 out of 10 , simply because there 's nothing lower  ",0
"This is one I did not have , but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel , and was very disappointed  ",0
"I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts , but the acting was as bad as the script  ",0
"Victor McLaglen was even bad , and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable  ",0
"Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck , it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them  ",0
But the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the President of the US  ,0
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving  ,0
The only thing worse than Taylor 's acting was Stanwyck 's singing  ,0
"Whatever the producer was going for , he missed entirely  ",0
"A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation , lots of underbite style stoic emoting think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow and some cheesy clichs thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo  ",0
Even the squibs look awful  ,0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America  ,0
"The plot , such as it is , is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing  ",0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time  ,0
"I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was , but not scared at all  ",0
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense  ,0
"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo,Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush , almost always in Olde English , and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words  ",0
The directing is sloppy at best  ,0
"Hackneyed writing , certainly , but made even worse by the bad directing  ",0
"Of course , the acting is blah  ",0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting  ,0
"And , FINALLY , after all that , we get to an ending that would 've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell  ",0
"I particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning , and even less meaning  ",0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs  ,0
About ten minutes into this film I started having second thoughts  ,0
About half way through this film I started to dislike it  ,0
"By the time the film ended , I not only disliked it , I despised it  ",0
What this film lacks is a convincing script  ,0
The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed  ,0
"Things happen , characters personalities change , plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it  ",0
This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life  ,0
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen  ,0
Everything about it is just bad  ,0
"I could not understand , what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season  ",0
"The script is bad , very bad , it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC , 17 movie  ",0
"The casting is also horrible , cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors , period  ",0
Final Word This Show is a real torture  ,0
It is zillion times away from reality  ,0
Watching washing machine twirling around would n't hurt your eyes as much as this show  ,0
Rating 0 or 10 Grade Z Note The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show  ,0
20th Century Fox 's ROAD HOUSE 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie  ,0
"Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov , who also produced , and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more  ",0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical  ,0
His losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing  ,0
"And if that is n't enough of a mess of a movie for you , the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors  ",0
Whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me  ,0
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment  ,0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start  ,0
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes  ,0
"first of all , there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone  ",0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs  ,0
"putting the race card aside , lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa 's character  ",0
there is no real plot  ,0
i wouldnt see this movie again for free  ,0
"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer , the next minute a Luv 's diaper commercial is completely unconvincing  ",0
"I 'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades , especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there  ",0
I do n't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake  ,0
This may be the only bad film he ever made  ,0
So badwellit 's just bad  ,0
"This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very , very bad idea all the way  ",0
It 's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this  ,0
I thought it was bad  ,0
"Both films are terrible , but to the credit of the 1986 version , it was watchable  ",0
"Let 's start with all the problems , the acting , especially from the lead professor , was very , very bad  ",0
The script is a big flawed mess  ,0
"The best example of how dumb the writing is when it 's established that you can turn the zombie,students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite  ",0
"Director Paul Matthews , who also wrote or directed the weak 1995 monster movie Grim , clearly does n't know how to pace his films  ",0
The movie is terribly boring in places  ,0
The lighting is awful  ,0
The film looks cheap and bland  ,0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore  ,0
"This convention never worked well in the past , and certainly does n't work here  ",0
The visual effects were AWFUL  ,0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God 's sake  ,0
The explosion of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful  ,0
"To sum the film up , Breeders is a terrible , cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus  ",0
Not recommended  ,0
"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen , he has little to no charisma , and terrible comedic timing  ",0
"Aside from it 's terrible lead , this film has loads of other debits  ",0
"I understand that it 's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy , but that does n't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence , and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive  ",0
"Lewis Black 's considerable talent is wasted here too , as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained , which the PG , 13 rating certainly will not allow  ",0
"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent , this remake had little else to offer  ",0
The budget was evidently very limited  ,0
"This was reflected not only in the cast , but also in the below,par script , which borrowed much from the earlier classic  ",0
"However , here there was no decent acting , action or location work to balance things up  ",0
Filmiing was less expansive  ,0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original  ,0
"Generally , it just lacked imagination  ",0
Not recommended  ,0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this,0
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place  ,0
"Even when the women finally show up , there is no sign of improvement , the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over , you might be far asleep  ",0
"Beware this is not a trashy cult movie , this is trash ,period  ",0
I can not believe there 's even a sequel to this  ,0
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review  ,0
"Every element of this story was so over the top , excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through  ",0
"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old , though they are trying oh so , so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really , um , you know , well talk  ",0
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done  ,0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie  ,0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles,0
"To be honest with you , this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish  ",0
"In conclusion , I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense  ",0
The story line is just awful  ,0
It 's just painful  ,0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal  ,0
There 's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit  ,0
"Do n't waste your time watching this rubbish non,researched film  ",0
Omit watching this  ,0
My rating just 3 out of 10  ,0
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew  ,0
"Regardless , the film fails on most levels  ",0
Avoid at all costs  ,0
"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him , but George was well dull  ",0
"He really did n't seem to want to be hosting , his voice,overs were monotonous , did n't get involved with the guests  ",0
"This movie is so mind,bendingly awful , it could n't have even been created  ",0
The film lacks any real scares or tension and some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least and I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself  ,0
The least said about the acting the better  ,0
"Even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini,series , this is bad  ",0
"Unless you 're just out to visually collect all extant films of Austen 's work , you can skip this one  ",0
It is not good  ,0
"Speaking of the music , it is unbearably predictably and kitchy  ",0
Then the film just dropped the ball  ,0
"There are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage , Joe 's glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact Joe 's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene  ",0
I can not see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection  ,0
It 's so bad it 's actually worth seeing just for that reason  ,0
Well Just if you keep thinking how bad it is  ,0
"It 's a mediocre , miserable , hollow , laughable and predictable piece of garbage  ",0
It 's a case of  so bad it is laughable,0
" very bad performance plays Angela Bennett , a computer expert who is at home all the time  ",0
"It is a film about nothing , just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes  ",0
How awful she is  ,0
"But she is still a bad actress , repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures  ",0
"The results , well , are a shame  ",0
DELETE this film from your mind  ,0
One of the worst shows of all time  ,0
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for  ,0
"The fat computer geek was unbelievable , the bible thumper , the bad,ass girl , who are these actors",0
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part  ,0
"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear , you see kids Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show  ",0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors  ,0
Lame would be the best way to describe it  ,0
"Im big fan of RPG games too , but this movie , its a disgrace to any self,respecting RPGer there is  ",0
"The lines , the cuts , the audio , everything is wrong  ",0
You can find better movies at youtube  ,0
"Top line Do n't waste your time and money on this one , its as bad as it comes  ",0
A Lassie movie which should have been put to sleep FOREVER  ,0
"That 's how I 'd describe this painfully dreary time,waster of a film  ",0
"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull , uninteresting mess , this is one of the most forgettable movies I 've seen  ",0
"It is n't even an achievement as a so bad , it 's  good or so bad , it 's memorable movie  ",0
"It 's an empty , hollow shell of a movie  ",0
"Seriously , it 's not worth wasting your , or your kid 's time on  ",0
"Avoid , avoid , avoid  ",0
It will drive you barking mad  ,0
Nothing new there  ,0
That was done in the second movie  ,0
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy  ,0
The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted  ,0
What on earth is Irons doing in this film,0
The football scenes at the end were perplexing  ,0
This scene is very strong and unpleasant  ,0
And it was boring  ,0
"I am so tired that is just lazy writing , and here they come in thick and fast  ",0
Why was this film made,0
"The film has an ultra , cheap look to it  ",0
The result is a film that just do n't look right  ,0
None of them are engaging or exciting  ,0
The plot is nonsense that does n't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it  ,0
The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time  ,0
"How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting , the story , the characters , the supposedly special effects , etcit 's ALL wrong  ",0
"In fact , this stinker smells like a direct,to,video release  ",0
Avoid at ALL costs  ,0
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series  ,0
"The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life , the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain  ",0
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dose n't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god seriously I just did n't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards  ,0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage  ,0
The worst one of the series  ,0
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist  ,0
It 's very slow  ,0
"Lot of holes in the plot there 's nothing about how he became the emperor , nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age  ",0
 Do n't waste your time  ,0
"End of Days is one of the worst big,budget action movies I 've ever seen  ",0
He surely does n't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money  ,0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen  ,0
I 'm still trying to get over how bad it was  ,0
"Otherwise , do n't even waste your time on this  ",0
This one just fails to create any real suspense  ,0
"As for the killer , do n't expect anything original or even remotely frightening  ",0
I 'm so sorry but I really can not recommend it to anyone  ,0
"One of the most boring ,pointless movies I have ever seen  ",0
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying  ,0
Hated it  ,0
This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad  ,0
"I do n't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store , it 's not even a real movie  ",0
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash  ,0
"This is not movie,making  ",0
"The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book , that 's how bad it is  ",0
"So I am here to warn you , DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE , it is the dumbest thing you have never seen  ",0
"I agree with Jessica , this movie is pretty bad  ",0
"Characters are one,dimensional , even the good guys and especially the bad guys  ",0
The story line is totally predictable  ,0
I 've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie  ,0
"Bad characters , bad story and bad acting  ",0
Really awful  ,0
Not easy to watch  ,0
"Just whatever you do , avoid Groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic  ",0
"It 's too bad that everyone else involved did n't share Crowe 's level of dedication to quality , for if they did , we 'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub,par mess  ",0
The movie seemed a little slow at first  ,0
"If you act in such a film , you should be glad that you 're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible  ",0
"This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 Deep Impact and Armageddon , and this one fails everywhere  ",0
If you have n't choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you 've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time  ,0
"Instead , we got a bore fest about a whiny , spoiled brat babysitting  ",0
I never walked out of a movie faster  ,0
I just got bored watching Jessice Lange take her clothes off  ,0
"Unfortunately , any virtue in this film 's production work was lost on a regrettable script  ",0

"Also , it 's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse  ",1
"Still , I do like this movie for it 's empowerment of women , there 's not enough movies out there like this one  ",1
An excellent performance from Ms  ,1
"Garbo , who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era I wanted to see some of her silent work , but Netflix does n't seem to be stocking them  ",1
It 's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion has n't missed a step going from silent to sound  ,1
This is such a fun and funny movie  ,1
Highly entertaining at all angles  ,1
"It features an outlandish array of memorable , psychotic but lovable nuts  ",1
"So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around , play games , and be dangerous  ",1
It even has its sweet moments  ,1
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine  ,1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played  ,1
And I really did find them funny  ,1
This is actually a very smart movie  ,1
There is a brilliant twist ending  ,1
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could  ,1
The writers were smack on and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showThese characters were so real  ,1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again  ,1
Now you know why I gave it a 10+  ,1
"I do n't know exactly what it is about this movie , but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family 's memories  ",1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is  ,1
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch  ,1
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other  ,1
"Much more interesting , more action , more suspense , and less of the unneeded controversy  ",1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid  ,1
Definitely worth checking out  ,1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen  ,1

"I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art , poetry , theater , politics , or Japanese history  ",1
"Here , in The Wind and the Lion , we see a wonderful rendering of America 's own Imperial age  ",1
" What makes this story different are the terrific production values , faultless photography , composition and editing , the terrific casting , the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy , and vivid history  ",1
"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son , every member of the family can identify with one of the characters , whether it be Sean Connery 's noble brigand , Candace Bergen 's feisty heroine , John Huston 's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly 's spiffy , radiant , ruthless can,do lieutenant , Roosevelt 's Big Stick  ",1
This is high adventure at its best  ,1
"I think it was Robert Ryans best film , because he portrayed someone like my father , and he was a schizophrenic in real life ,my father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse  ",1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt  ,1
"My mother and brother had to do thisWhen I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man , it was a very good imitation of this type of individual , and I was impressed  ",1
Non linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well  ,1
The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful  ,1
A good commentary of today 's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing  ,1
"For people who are first timers in film making , I think they did an excellent job  ",1
"It was very popular when I was in the cinema , a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs  ",1
"It 's a feel,good film and that 's how I felt when I came out of the cinema  ",1
It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents  ,1
I rather enjoyed it  ,1
I liked it  ,1
It really created a unique feeling though  ,1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script  ,1
A world better than 95 percents of the garbage in the theatres today  ,1
Her role was played well  ,1
Not too screamy not to masculine but just right  ,1
The camera really likes her in this movie  ,1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script  ,1
"As a European , the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980 's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities , although the circumstances were slightly different  ",1
"This movie is excellentAngel is beautiful and Scamp is adorableHis little yelps when hes scared ,and the funniest parts are whenScamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'I totally recommend this movie ,its coming out on special edition on June 20The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid  ",1

"An interesting premise , and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut,bag side note I 'd love to see Drago , Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together , talk about raging cheekbones  ",1
"The soundtrack was n't terrible , either  ",1
"Still , it was the SETS that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale  ",1
Both do good jobs and are quite amusing  ,1
The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well  ,1
"I like Armand Assante and my cable company 's summary sounded interesting , so I watched it , twice already , and probably will again  ",1
I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends  ,1
My 8 or 10 score is mostly for the plot  ,1
"I will not say any more , I do n't like spoilers , so I do n't want to be one , but I believe this film is worth your time  ",1

"This movie contained an all star cast , and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I have n't seen before  ",1
"This movie was kind of long in length , but I enjoyed every minute of it  ",1
Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale  ,1

"Totally different , with loads of understatement and black comedy , this is a film few get to see , but those who do will remember it  ",1
"This movie creates its own universe , and is fascinating in every way  ",1
But this movie really got to me  ,1
See it  ,1
"I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies , and that they will continue to do so in their own , some kinda weird style  ",1
"And I forgot The Casting here i superb , with Trond Fausa Aurvg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man , who does n't understand where he is , what he is doing and why  ",1
This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006  ,1
"I found this move beautiful , enjoyable , and uplifting  ",1
"Initially the local sites in the film , which was filmed here in Buffalo , intrigued me  ",1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film  ,1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film  ,1
"I left the theater with a lilt in my step , joy in my heart and hope for the human race  ",1
Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance  ,1
The rest of the cast also play well  ,1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers  ,1
The cast is good  ,1
"For that , it 's worth checking out  ",1
the cast was great  ,1
"steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middle,aged , upper class , uptight white guy  ",1
"add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast , everyone played their parts really well  ",1
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history  ,1
"This second appearance of Mickey Mouse following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year is probably his most famous film , mostly because it was so ground,breaking  ",1
"While you do n't yet hear Mickey speak , there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film , something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928  ",1
"However , after seeing the short again after about 25 years , I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is  ",1
It 's just adorable seeing Mickey playing Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way  ,1
"Clever and a real crowd,pleaser , this film still ranks among Mickey 's best films even after 80 wonderful years  ",1
The original Body and Soul 1947 is a masterpiece  ,1
"John Garfield , Ann revere , Lilli Plmer , William Conrad , Canada Leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenJames Wong Howe  ",1
"Okay , I like to consider myself a fair critic , so I 'll give credit where credit 's due , the creature effects were actually pretty cool  ",1
"Gotta love those close,ups of slimy , drooling teeth  ",1
The film 's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim  ,1
"Being a 90 's child , I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons  ",1
"But Tiny Toons kept the 90 's vibe and delivered one of the most popular , funny , and underrated cartoons ever created  ",1
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show  ,1
"Easily , none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers  ",1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character  ,1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead  ,1
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera  ,1
I believe that Pitch Black was done well  ,1
"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on , and I think people will be surprised by who does and does n't make it  ",1
Go watch it  ,1
VERY funny  ,1
The characters are interesting and you really care for them  ,1
"An instant classic , with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits  ",1
Do n't miss it  ,1
"This is a masterful piece of film,making , with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet 's bohemian , self,indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat , the borderlines between friendship , lust and love , dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns , jealousy , rivalry , cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self,sacrifice and more  ",1
"A mature , subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to , though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it  ",1
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment , with inventive and elegant use of close up , camera angle and lighting , including pointillistic faux home movie footage , is a wonder and joy to behold  ",1
"It 's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci , but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master 's work  ",1
"I saw this film over Christmas , and what a great film it was  ",1
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor  ,1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic  ,1
"I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor , and I grew up watching his films as a child  ",1
But it was n't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was  ,1
I 'll give this film 10 out of 10  ,1
"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock , with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy , a kidnapped child , a nasty church , a foreign plot and some random taxidermists  ",1
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock , the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function , but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock 's black and white , low,budget original  ",1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master 's stable  ,1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film  ,1
"Excellently produced by one of Sci,fi 's best producers Scot Vandiver   ",1
"But it is entertaining , nonetheless  ",1
It 's a campy sort of film that 's a joy to watch  ,1
There 's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts  ,1
The cast is always entertaining as usual  ,1
"Overall , a delight  ",1
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa  ,1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process  ,1
Nothing short of magnificent photography or cinematography in this film  ,1
"The acting is fantastic , the stories are seamlessly woven together , and the dogs are splendid A must rent , view or see  ",1
Do n't be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 10 or 100,1
Excellent performance  ,1
There still are good actors around  ,1
Also great directing and photography  ,1
"Very true to Shakespear , and a  'must' for all Shakespear fans  ",1
"Macbeth Jason Connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle , outHe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face , which makes it the more interesting  ",1
"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl , but deadly in her taste for blood and evil  ",1
"If you love death and decay , and Shakespears lyrics this is the one  ",1
"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book , brilliantly animated by UPA 's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award  ",1
"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects , which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon  ",1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film about Mishima that is both superb and complex  ,1
Also notable is John Bailey 's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design and costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola 's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar  ,1
"If you do watch it , however , there are small consolations The actresses playing Anne 's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles  ",1
This is a stunning movie  ,1
Raw and sublimely moving  ,1
"It felt like a very gripping , intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyone 's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences  ",1
All of the main players are mesmerising  ,1
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone else 's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike  ,1
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again  ,1
He 's a national treasure  ,1
GO AND SEE IT  ,1
This is an excellent film  ,1

It was also the right balance of war and love  ,1

This is just a great movie  ,1
10 out of 10 stars  ,1
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema  ,1

You wont regret it  ,1

The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character  ,1

The transfers are very good  ,1
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing  ,1
The movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title  ,1

"The point is the journey , a journey that touches every member of the family  ",1

"A very good film indeed , about great and unconditional love  ",1
"Tom Wilkinson 's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin , but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses , and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character 's anguish and suffering  ",1
"Emily Watson 's character is very strong , and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything  ",1
"Despite the pans of reviewers , I liked this movie  ",1

"Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha , in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene  ",1
"I 'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice 's style , sensitivities and treatments  ",1
"I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction , he was believable  ",1
But I thought his acting was skilled  ,1

A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart  ,1
"It is rare when a film,maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that does n't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent  ",1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film  ,1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre  ,1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70 's  ,1
A standout scene  ,1
"Technically , the film is well made with impressive camera,work , solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani , particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it 's coming from a distant hill  ",1
It 's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema  ,1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end  ,1
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman 's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son  ,1

PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up  ,1
"It 's a fresh , subtle , and rather sublime effect  ",1
"An Italian reviewer called this a small , great film , and that 's right  ",1
"All the actors give a wonderful performance , especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris , who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star  ",1
"You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie , and a lot about the movie business itself  ",1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating  ,1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I 've ever heard  ,1
You will not forget this movie  ,1
"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973 , when it was The Stranger and I loved it  ",1
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut 's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR  ,1
This movie is so awesome  ,1

I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there  ,1

You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars  ,1
"The acting , as you 'd expect from this cast , is top notch  ",1

"It 's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 , as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time  ",1
"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand , for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser,known cast and for the super,intelligent script that does n't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism  ",1

"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez 's directorial debut , but the pacing , the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye  ",1

Simply beautiful  ,1
"Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who ,  maybe ,  has written a subversive tract  ",1

It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives  ,1
But it picked up speed and got right to the point  ,1
It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget  ,1

"Hayao Miyazaki 's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili , Gake No Ue No Ponyo Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood  ",1
"At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney or Pixar 's CGI masterpieces , it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand,drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories  ",1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film  ,1
The art style has the appearance of crayon or pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful  ,1
"Still , it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost  ",1
"Just consider the excellent story , solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses  ",1

 PALINDROMES 2005 Ellen Barkin,2
The offbeat indie filmmaker,2
The film begins with the closed casket funeral of Dollhouse 's WienerDog,2
"	Solondz employs a gimmick of using an octet of actresses of different races",2
"	What happens next is Aviva running away from home to be discovered by a family of adopted children of different backgrounds and with some handicaps all under the roof of the Christian Mama Sunshine Monk and her evangelical husband Bo Bobbie  who both seem too good to be true with their altruistic intentions",2
"	A haggard looking Leigh also shocks in her seemingly drugged turn before the film 's end",2
"	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements",2
"	In this second cousin to Dollhouse the film does n't cohese easily as its far superior black comic or tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too,apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America read abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right,to,lifers yet Aviva does get across one true theme we are not who we seem to be",2
" BLACK Christmas 2006 , 1 or 2 Katie Cassidy",2
"	The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor",2
"	In the original the killer is never really figured out in spite of his trademark sick phone calls pranked on the nubile young women who anger him to the point of some truly nasty and twisted murders",2
"	The schizophrenic nature of the character is fleshed out to include incest and a twist that is best left unsaid",2
"	Director Glen Morgan who helmed Final Destination does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie,jeebies",2
 For trivia buffs Martin who appeared in the original as a victim returns this time as the mother hen to the sorority under siege,2
" HOSTEL 2006 , Jay Hernandez",2

"	Along the way they encountered an odd Danish businessman Vlasak whose clumsy pass at Josh infuriated the young man to no end but the two meet again unlikely at the local watering hole and deciding to make international peace Josh buys the Dane a drink and some words of advice",2
"	The next thing he knows it",2
"	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore,iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none,other,than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad,handling the media declaring this to be the scariest",2
"	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet 's gang of pre, pubescent street gang as some ersatz Village of the Damned is highly welcomed finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well,endowed and hot the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver shock",2
"	In fact if feels like a glimpse of The Gimp sequence from Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction several scenes feel cribbed from this and could best describe the film as a whole",2
" ANNAPOLIS 2006 , James Franco",2
"	All the years of his backbreaking work with his contractor father Bill Goodman has him burning inside and expressing his frustrations by boxing at amateur bouts in town until one day he catches the eye of LtCmdr Burton Wahlberg doing a mean Ed Harris imitation who offers young Jake a shot at redemption",2

"	Sadly these will be the last fond memories Jonathan will treasure",2
"	Anna is killed in a freak accident while changing a tire she falls into the nearby waters and drowns leaving a distraught",2
 Enter mysterious Brit Raymond Price McNeice who informs the overwhelmed Rivers that Anna has been speaking to him in an ethereal device known as EVP Electronic Voice Phenomenon communication thru the white noise static of audio devices and eventually a ghostly video format,2
"	Naturally Rivers is at first affronted and skeptical but then finds himself at Price 's home where he is in the midst of  'session' with another begrieved client",2
"	It is here where Rivers gets a sample of just what Price has been trying to explain which sets the plot line of the film",2
Rivers becomes obsessed and convinced he can make contact with his late wife and will stop at nothing including his good mental health and further distancing from his first wife and child Strange and Elia,2
"	Namely how we the living try to comprehend the world of the dead and the afterlife if one even does occur and largely opening a Pandora 's box of inexplicable evil while attempting to cope with one 's own mortality",2
The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its X Files approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax making his big screen directorial debut also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole,2
"	She gives him three cars totalling more than 750",2
 I thought that the original Psycho 1960 was a masterpiece,2
"	Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time",2

"	They spend the better part of a year trying to survive until the orbit of Mars is close enough to return to earth",2
"	I 'm going to be the exception to the flow of thumbs up fans of this K Bacon movie",2
"	Sharing a very close bond the family has kept pretty much to themselves except that Jack has been seeing a woman named Kathleen the always welcome Catherine Keener on shore",2
"	Naturally this sudden invite causes some alarm for all parties involved shaking up the ecosystem he has preserved and rattling the fragile yet rebellious Rose to no end on the first night alone when the taken,with,cosmetology Rodney experiments on her hair with a severe crop she pulls a shotgun on the sleeping bodies of her father 's new lover with a funny take , no one gets hurt but things get shaken up to more stirrings down the road",2

"	Dir Susannah Grant Jennifer is a great catch and the film is n't half bad either",2
"	Jennifer Garner is the ideal girl next door",2
"	Instead of a wedding she now has a funeral to deal with",2
"	However all is not lost in the sense she is alone",2
"	Quite the contrary , her betrothed 's fun,loving childhood friends are there to see her through including Sam filmmaker Smith who steals the film with his smartly delivered one,liners and the ongoing running gag of the stout fellow in various modes of unkempt solvent shoving something down his endless gullet to high comic effect",2
"	All three men are in love with Grey and can you blame them",2
"	but each has their own philosophy in how her grief should ultimately lead to a happier existence",2

"	Maybe that 's a bit refreshing or I 'ma tad too cynical or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight",2
" JOSHUA 2007 , Sam Rockwell",2
"	Is it simply that one child cannot justify the others' existence except for a battle to be more loved by their parents or is it something altogether an innate",2
"	Joshua is a smart,beyond his years child but he is taking a dark turn with his studies he takes to the Egyptian method of embalming mummies after a class study breaks his void of finding a niche in something to peak his interests",2
"	He clearly loves his family",2
"	When things begin to get difficult Abby is placed into an institution after an accident causes her to become dependent on painkillers and other meds",2
"	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN dapper",2
" SERAPHIM FALLS 2007 , Pierce Brosnan",2
"	In its latest incarnation",2
"	There are a few tweaks to the gee 's stock characters young gun bank robbers , a railroad crew of hostile Irishmen and victimized Chinese slave labor , wise Indian proclaiming nuggets of choice phrasings , a snake,oil saleswoman Huston at her slyest who may,or, may,not,be,a,desert,mirage , and the off,beat missionaries on pilgrimage",2
" WIND CHILL 2007 , Emily Blunt",2
"	Dir Gregory Jacobs The Sure Thing meets The Twilight Zone Everyone loves a good ghost story and the latest installment on screen is a well,crafted suspenser that feels like The Sure Thing meets The Twilight Zone if written by Stephen King Set in the frost,bitten winter of a small Pennsylvania college campus days before the Christmas break",2

" In the latest true,life account the sport is swimming and the athlete is Australia 's national champion Tony Fingleton circa the 1950s , early 1960s",2
 His main cause of bitterness is apparently his son Tony 's good and natured,2
 Harold sees this magical moment as his ticket by coaching his lads gruelingly to stardom and becomes obsessed in their times by carrying his ubiquitous stopwatch at all times and having the boys go at the crack of dawn every day until they are young men equally scrabbling to make names of themselves and eventually to disembark their trappings for the real world,2

 The Bottom Line The camera is okay for those who want a high resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than 100 dollars I bought this camera on sale for 99 dollars,2
"	Many reviews refer to battery power issues",2
"	I also read on Gateway 's web site that they specifically recommend the nickel NiMHAA batteries rather than alkaline",2

"	Paramore just recently broke into the scene and have become very well known in a very short amount of time",2
Pressure has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single,2
"Emergency and Brighter both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop,rock songs",2
Here We Go Again demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses,2
Never Let This Go is a welcome change of pace to the album,2
Whoa has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album,2
Consipracy and Franklin also have basic lyrics,2
 The songs are n't going to win any awards from lyric lovers ,2
"	These few songs show the age of the band the most",2
All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head,2
"	This album took me by surprise",2
"	Moreover people who dance so well",2
"	First and foremost",2
"	Combine all of them",2
"	There are a few straightforward pop songs , I would defy anyone to listen to Your Kind Turn Me All Around without catching it flying sorties around your brain a day later",2
"	And there 's a hint of Beatles flavour to When the Ancients Fly ",2
"	And if you enjoy this",2
"	Purchased this with expectations that the mini,games would be easy to get into and fun",2
"	Here 's the deal",2
"	This game has a few things going for it",2
"	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters",2
"	My complaints with the game are as follows",2
"	I 've been am avid gamer for nearly two decades now",2
2K Sports was kicking EA Sports in the football category,2
"	The game was built on the Ueal Engine like America 's Army",2
"	The game does n't offer large",2
"	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for",2
"	It 's a mindless sort of fun",2
"	At least I still have Fight Night",2
"	RENT OR BUY",2
"	Sincerely signed",2
"	 Check your bargain bin Being a huge fan of UfC",2
"	I knew beforehand that the game got average reviews",2
"	I liked it on the dream cast though and wanted to add a different type of fighting game to my collection",2
"	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling",2
"	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking",2
"	The blood does n't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe",2
"	Do n't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock",2
"	The fighting mechanics consist of Left and right punch buttons and left and right kick buttons",2
"	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out",2
"	The previous 3 or 2 in this case were based on platforming with some 1 on 1 battles for bosses",2
"	This game is entirely mission based",2
"	While this game is easy for the most part",2
"	I 'm sure most have heard of a game called Jump Super Stars or Ultimate Stars before",2
"	Certain characters like Naruto have jutsu 's that are highlighted in blue",2
"	Sakura also has a healing ability that might prolong multiplayer matches",2
I preordered a copy and all that,2
"	I went to pick it up",2
"	But I had yet to explore any real meat",2
"	The next day would be SSBB 's judgment day",2
"	Why is this",2
"	Well there are many reasons",2
"	But that 's really all SSBB is to me",2
" Eye Candy Sound 7 or 10 , While the sound is nothing special",2
"	I played all 51 and what do I get",2
"	A stage or two",2
" At this point it 's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore Longevity 01 or 10 , Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4 After SSBB loses its value in single player",2
"	But rent it anyway just to see if you agree with my viewpoint",2
"	In this game instead of saving animals you actually save flowers",2
"	Oh and why can not you use Tails or Amy is this game",2
"	I mean Amy is right their shown in this game and you could use Tail in the one before this Sonic 2 but why not here",2
"	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do",2
"	Throughout most of the game",2
"	There 's also an RPG element to the game",2
"	i did n't even clear at least 75 percents of the game however",2
"	I made the mistake of playing the game at the difficult level rather than normal ",2
"	The N64 version of Diddy Kong Racing was highly overlooked because it was launched along side the notorious Mario Kart 64 Diddy Kong Racing was easily overshadowed because of Mario",2
"	The story is nothing to die for",2
"	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version",2
"	In the story once you complete all the races in one world",2
"	There are three levels bronze",2
"	If you compared Mario Kart DS and Diddy Kong Racing DS you could clearly see the difference in graphics",2
"	Replay value often makes and breaks the game",2
"	In this game 's case it has moderate replay value",2
"	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value",2
"	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value",2
"	The game is simply a port from the N64",2
"	 Ambitious OK the game is basically the same as Star,force 1 What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme",2
"	At least the main character is less whiny",2
"	Playability 25  or  5 it is pretty much the same as the first game",2
"	If you play for a hour and a half everyday then buy it but if you play for much longer pick up a different game",2
"	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them",2
"	Rydia from FF4 held our interest because we got to see her develop from childhood to adulthood in an epic",2
"	Terra 's character pulled at our heart strings as we saw the oppression of her people",2
"	Even Aeris from FF7 touched us when she was killed by Sephiroth",2
"	I know what Square was attempting",2
"	They were trying to develop the characters through a series of normal events",2
"	Now for the actual plot of the game",2
"	Disc one is spent going between the different characters",2
"	Zidane is the main character",2
 This may be due to the fact that his character consists of do n't be mad,2
"	There are points in the game where he admits to abuse he suffered in childhood",2
"	Final Fantasy 4 and 6 were noted for their originality and ability to draw players into the game for hours at a time",2
"	a few At least the characters are somewhat different from one another",2
"	You still get AP points and learn powerful abilities through weapons",2
"	By the middle of the game",2
"	Magic is learned very very slowly in this game",2
"	Instead of limit breakers",2
"	I never died playing this game",2
"	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses",2
"	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs",2
"	At least the draw system although it was weird and a little dumb was an original idea",2
"	Then one of my friends showed me banjo kazooie",2
"	Then i saw this game",2
"	But does it really matter",2
"	You can easily master your character after a while",2
"	As for the game difficulty",2

"	If you are a person who get scared really easily",2
"	Seven years after Cornell 's quest",2
"	Unless you 're a huge Castlevania fan",2
"	This game is hard to find",2

"	You could wander around in the village",2
"	Harvest Moon games",2

"	You can have a little fun riding your horse",2
"	All HM have a story like that",2
"	It 's not a bad story",2
 Score 5 or 10 Play Time  or  Replayability Like long games,2

"	Wonder what 's next",2
"	The controls you have to get used to",2
"	Overall The best in the series",2
"	You really spend most of your micro,management on the heroes you usually have 2 at a time",2
"	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much",2
"	Some people complain that other games have more",2
"	But in those other games",2
"	This usually makes only one or two factions dominant",2
"	The simple fact of RTS games is that graphics are n't that important anyway",2
"	It just is n't a big deal to me in an RTS",2

"	Impeaching Mere Creationism is an attempt to debunk the intelligent design and creation movements",2
"	The effectiveness of the book is accurately revealed when Frymire admitted that he had never read a creationist book until he read Johnson 's Defeating Darwinism",2
"	Then he read two other of Johnson 's books",2
"	I have read several hundred books on creationism",2
"	This will be obvious to an informed creationists",2
"	And evolutionists wonder why they are ineffective in converting creationists",2
"	As they say",2
"	One could add",2
"	To find out what is true will then be even more difficult",2
"	This reminds me of the false rumor spread for so long that the Procter and Gamble symbol has something to do with demonism",2
"	They finally gave up trying to squash the rumor and dumped the symbol",2
"	I was very curious to read this book because of all the hype",2

"	Beyonce Knowles is a very talented woman She is a good actress which we are to see more of this summer",2
"	Maybe this is why the last Destiny 's Child album",2
"	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are Crazy In Love and Yes ",2
"	Let 's just hope they lose each other 's numbers",2
"	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the  'metal' scene in years",2
"	Just scroll down the reviews and see how many kidies have referred to their disturbing and satanic image",2
"	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD 's in both STEREO and MONO",2
"	I say this because",2
"	It pains me to give a King 's X album such a low score",2
"	I remember hearing them for the first time as a kid watching late,night TV when their video for Over My Head made a splash for a while on MTV I 've been a fan ever since",2
"	The title track is passable",2
"	It has a great variety of sound",2
"	I 'm a fan of both eras",2
"	Where is the Brad Paisley with the rockin' guitar sound",2
"	I am definately not the biggest Beyonce fan by far",2
"	But this is Beyonce we 're talking about",2
"	It had the typical independent ladies song",2
"	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot",2
"	I 'm sure she 'll notice the poor feedback from this cd and the next will be incredible",2
"	She should definately take her time and create an album with songs that have some staying power",2
"	I 'm a younger Andrews Sisters fan",2
"	I was first turned onto them when I heard Rum and Coca Cola , did I want to hear more after that",2
"	You 've never heard these songs until you 've heard the originals",2
"	I recommend The Andrews Sisters , Their All,Time Greated Hits MCA , sold here at Amazon too , it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes",2
"	The original Rum and Coca Cola and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy are pure magic",2
"	It 's good that they put Newly Recorded on the cover",2
"	If you 're like me",2
"	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording",2
"	Ever since discovering the Dark Side , I have been a PF fanatic",2
"	Roger 's themes and words",2
 The previous release in the Back To Love series was a closing of the chapter from 90 and it was an amazing finish to that era and so I was excited to see what 96 classics featured on the next instalment,2
"	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe",2
"	It will be interesting to see who comes out on top",2
 Gees and subgees annoy me,2
"	I know they 're a necessary evil",2
"	I know that is highly subjective",2
"	There is little here that is edgy or super original",2
"	Successful at being average",2
"	This was my first time hearing Il Divo",2

"	For everyone else",2
"	A tune such as They 're Red Hot ",2
"	What happened to the great live,in,the,studio feel of From The Cradle",2
"	Sounds like Mr Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode",2
"	He drops into this mode from time to time , he practically lived in this mode the entire decade of the seventies",2
"	Seriously he is so gifted",2
"	He wrote most of the songs for Commissioned",2
"	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album original members only and sing the songs that was n't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray",2

When I heard Mari Digby on NPR 's Morning Edition Saturday with Scott Simon last year,2
"	The album was enchanting from open to close and most of its tracks remain in heavy rotation on my iPod",2
"	I could listen to this collection of songs over and over without losing interest",2
"	She loves it , she lives it",2
"	She works hard at her craft and the success of Unfold garnered her a well,deserved higher profile",2
"	And she never stops",2
"	She was clearly keen to explore a new path",2
"	 Breathing Underwater is the expression of this desire",2
" Mari is completely ga,ga over her new baby ",2
"	And that 's as it should be",2
"Mari is the beautiful woman who does n't need makeup , you cringe a little bit when you see her layer it on in an apparent attempt to be more like her peers",2
 In the end it 's Mari 's call,2
"	I have no doubt that Breathing Underwater will do very well for her",2
"	Did I buy it",2
"Mari wanted to move away from Unfold I 'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving , on to something different for her third album",2
 Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7 I 'll still see her when she tours,2
"	That will likely be my best chance to hear acoustic versions of the new songs",2
"	Formed by a former Throbbing Gristler and a buddy",2
"	Some of their albums consist of little more than curious drones",2
Loves Secret Domain,2
"	This their most accessible album tends to be their best",2
Stolen and Contaminated Songs,2
"	This album is not as good nor accessible",2
"	Do n't expect the sonata form",2
Only at the repeated insistence of my friend A did I sit down and really listen to this album,2
 I must admit that I regard much contemporary randb and hiphop with skepticism because of the same lack of individuality that is rife in the boyband repertoire,2

"	Now that we 've got that out of the way",2
"	 Released When You Are Dead opens the album in a deceptive manner",2
"	From here the songs become more melodic",2
"	In an earlier review I had stated that TD 's Melrose was their most haunting since this one",2
"	Does that sound like someone on an acid trip?",2
"	Rock is not always about intensity",2
"	Just because a song has no screaming and yelling does not mean it is not a good song",2

"	JoJo or Ciara would be good singing with them",2
"	This game 's challenge is to make a town into a five star town but to do this you must make items for your sims and houses throughout the whole game and find essences",2

"	Most everyone and their mom have played Bejeweled",2
"	This will make them disappear and anything above the animals in the line will fall to fill the space",2
"	There is a timer on the left side that you must keep from running out by capturing more animals",2
"	It makes it seem like Bejeweled Zoo Keeper was initially designed for the DS Click on the animal and drag and it will rotate in the direction you drag",2
"	Quest is extremely hard to place in as the game has you do specific tasks like capturing 20 lions without capturing too many other animals",2
"	Luck because sometimes animals will just conveniently continue to line up as more animals fall from the top",2
